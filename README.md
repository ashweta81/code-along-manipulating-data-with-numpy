### Project Overview

 Sales Campaign analysis
An introduction to the Facebook advertising platform
Along with Google's search and display networks, Facebook is one of the big players when it comes to online advertising. As Facebook users interact with the platform, adding demographic information, liking particular pages and commenting on specific posts, Facebook builds a profile of that user based on who they are and what they're interested in.
This fact makes Facebook very attractive for advertisers. Advertisers can create Facebook adverts, then create an 'Audience' for that advert or group of adverts. Audiences can be built from a range of attributes including gender, age, location and interests. This specific targetting means advertisers can tailor content appropriately for a specific audience, even if the product being marketed is the same.
What do we need from our Facebook ads analysis?
When it comes to analysing the Facebook adverts dataset, there are a lot of questions we can ask, and a lot of insight we can generate. However, from a business perspective we want to ask questions that will give us answers we can use to improve business performance.
Without knowing anything of the company's marketing strategy or campaign objectives, we do not know which key performance indicators (KPIs) are the most important. For example, a new company may be focussed on brand awareness and may want to maximise the amount of impressions, being less concerned about how well these adverts perform in terms of generating clicks and revenue. Another company may simply want to maximise the amount of revenue, while minimising the amount it spends on advertising.
As these two objectives are very different, it is important to work with the client to understand exactly what they are hoping to achieve from their marketing campaigns before beginning any analysis in order to ensure that our conclusions are relevant and, in particular, actionable. There's not much point in producing a report full of insight, if there's nothing the client can do about it.
Understanding the dataset
The data used in this project is from an anonymous organisationâ€™s social media ad campaign. The data contains 1143 observations in 11 variables. Below are the descriptions of the variables. Since you are working with numpy, refer the Feature Index column for the indices of every feature.
